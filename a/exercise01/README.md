# a. Structure of backend application, introduction to testing

Let's continue our work on the backend of the notes application we started in part 3.

## Project structure
Before we move into the topic of testing, we will modify the structure of our project to adhere to Node.js best practices.

After making the changes to the directory structure of our project, we end up with the following structure:
```
├── index.js
├── app.js
├── build
│   └── ...
├── controllers
│   └── notes.js
├── models
│   └── note.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── utils
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── logger.js
│   └── middleware.js  
```
So far we have been using console.log and console.error to print different information from the code. However, this is not a very good way to do things. Let's separate all printing to the console to its own module utils/logger.js:
```
const info = (...params) => {
  console.log(...params)
}

const error = (...params) => {
  console.error(...params)
}

module.exports = {
  info, error
}
```
The logger has two functions, info for printing normal log messages, and error for all error messages.

Extracting logging into its own module is a good idea in more ways than one. If we wanted to start writing logs to a file or send them to an external logging service like graylog or papertrail we would only have to make changes in one place.

The contents of the index.js file used for starting the application gets simplified as follows:
```
const app = require('./app') // the actual Express application
const http = require('http')
const config = require('./utils/config')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')

const server = http.createServer(app)

server.listen(config.PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
})
```
The index.js file only imports the actual application from the app.js file and then starts the application. The function info of the logger-module is used for the console printout telling that the application is running.

The handling of environment variables is extracted into a separate utils/config.js file:
```
require('dotenv').config()

const PORT = process.env.PORT
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI

module.exports = {
  MONGODB_URI,
  PORT
}
```
The other parts of the application can access the environment variables by importing the configuration module:
```
const config = require('./utils/config')

logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
```
The route handlers have also been moved into a dedicated module. The event handlers of routes are commonly referred to as controllers, and for this reason we have created a new controllers directory. All of the routes related to notes are now in the notes.js module under the controllers directory.

The contents of the notes.js module are the following:
```
const notesRouter = require('express').Router()
const Note = require('../models/note')

notesRouter.get('/', (request, response) => {
  Note.find({}).then(notes => {
    response.json(notes)
  })
})

notesRouter.get('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  Note.findById(request.params.id)
    .then(note => {
      if (note) {
        response.json(note)
      } else {
        response.status(404).end()
      }
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.post('/', (request, response, next) => {
  const body = request.body

  const note = new Note({
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important || false,
    date: new Date()
  })

  note.save()
    .then(savedNote => {
      response.json(savedNote)
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.delete('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  Note.findByIdAndRemove(request.params.id)
    .then(() => {
      response.status(204).end()
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.put('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  const body = request.body

  const note = {
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important,
  }

  Note.findByIdAndUpdate(request.params.id, note, { new: true })
    .then(updatedNote => {
      response.json(updatedNote)
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

module.exports = notesRouter
```
This is almost an exact copy-paste of our previous index.js file.

However, there are a few significant changes. At the very beginning of the file we create a new router object:
```
const notesRouter = require('express').Router()

//...

module.exports = notesRouter
```
The module exports the router to be available for all consumers of the module.

All routes are now defined for the router object, in a similar fashion to what we had previously done with the object representing the entire application.

It's worth noting that the paths in the route handlers have shortened. In the previous version, we had:
```
app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
```
And in the current version, we have:
```
notesRouter.delete('/:id', (request, response) => {
```
So what are these router objects exactly? The Express manual provides the following explanation:

A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.
The router is in fact a middleware, that can be used for defining "related routes" in a single place, that is typically placed in its own module.

The app.js file that creates the actual application, takes the router into use as shown below:
```
const notesRouter = require('./controllers/notes')
app.use('/api/notes', notesRouter)
```
The router we defined earlier is used if the URL of the request starts with /api/notes. For this reason, the notesRouter object must only define the relative parts of the routes, i.e. the empty path / or just the parameter /:id.

After making these changes, our app.js file looks like this:
```
const config = require('./utils/config')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const cors = require('cors')
const notesRouter = require('./controllers/notes')
const middleware = require('./utils/middleware')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

logger.info('connecting to', config.MONGODB_URI)

mongoose.connect(config.MONGODB_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useFindAndModify: false, useCreateIndex: true })
  .then(() => {
    logger.info('connected to MongoDB')
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    logger.error('error connecting to MongoDB:', error.message)
  })

app.use(cors())
app.use(express.static('build'))
app.use(express.json())
app.use(middleware.requestLogger)

app.use('/api/notes', notesRouter)

app.use(middleware.unknownEndpoint)
app.use(middleware.errorHandler)

module.exports = app
```
The file takes different middleware into use, and one of these is the notesRouter that is attached to the /api/notes route.

Our custom middleware has been moved to a new utils/middleware.js module:
```
const logger = require('./logger')

const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  logger.info('Method:', request.method)
  logger.info('Path:  ', request.path)
  logger.info('Body:  ', request.body)
  logger.info('---')
  next()
}

const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' })
}

const errorHandler = (error, request, response, next) => {
  logger.error(error.message)

  if (error.name === 'CastError') {
    return response.status(400).send({ error: 'malformatted id' })
  } else if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
    return response.status(400).json({ error: error.message })
  }

  next(error)
}

module.exports = {
  requestLogger,
  unknownEndpoint,
  errorHandler
}
```
The responsibility of establishing the connection to the database has been given to the app.js module. The note.js file under the models directory only defines the Mongoose schema for notes.
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5
  },
  date: {
    type: Date,
    required: true,
  },
  important: Boolean,
})

noteSchema.set('toJSON', {
  transform: (document, returnedObject) => {
    returnedObject.id = returnedObject._id.toString()
    delete returnedObject._id
    delete returnedObject.__v
  }
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('Note', noteSchema)
```
To recap, the directory structure looks like this after the changes have been made:
```
├── index.js
├── app.js
├── build
│   └── ...
├── controllers
│   └── notes.js
├── models
│   └── note.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── utils
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── logger.js
│   └── middleware.js  
```
For smaller applications the structure does not matter that much. Once the application starts to grow in size, you are going to have to establish some kind of structure, and separate the different responsibilities of the application into separate modules. This will make developing the application much easier.

There is no strict directory structure or file naming convention that is required for Express applications. To contrast this, Ruby on Rails does require a specific structure. Our current structure simply follows some of the best practices you can come across on the internet.

You can find the code for our current application in its entirety in the part4-1 branch of this Github repository.

If you clone the project for yourself, run the npm install command before starting the application with npm start.
